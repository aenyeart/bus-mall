NOTE: In naming my variables and functions, I am using "product" for the backend data objects, and "option" when the product is being prepared for and presented to the user as something they can select.

## TODO / Order of work: 

- ~~Build placeholder HTML based on wireframe~~
- ~~Display three images using DOM manip via render function~~
- ~~Create Product constructor function~~
- ~~Create array of products (create function to do this from arbitrary number of images in folder)~~
- ~~Build randomizer()~~
- ~~Test on simple array~~
- Add click eventListener with counter variable
